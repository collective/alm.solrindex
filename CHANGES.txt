----------------

  the front page, where we get ambiguity errors.
  [maurits]

- Fixed the catalog object information page.  Solr was unable to parse
  a negative number in the query.


0.8 (2009-09-18)
----------------

- Added support for Solr boolean fields.

- GenericSetup profiles now have the option of clearing the
  index.

- Made the waituri script wait up to 90 seconds by default,
  pause a little more between polls, and accept a timeout
  parameter.

0.7 (2009-09-13)
----------------

- The Solr URI can now be provided by an environment variable,
  so that catalog.xml does not need to hard code the URI.

0.6 (2009-09-11)
----------------

- Added narrative documentation.

- Don't clear the index when running GenericSetup.  Clearing
  indexes turns out to be a long-standing problem with GenericSetup;
  in this case the easy solution is to just not clear it.

0.5 (2009-09-10)
----------------

- Added a script that waits for Solr to start up.

- Brought in a private copy of solrpy to fix some bugs:

  - The connection retry code reconnected, but wasn't
    actually retrying the request.

  - The raw_query method should not assume the parameter
    values are unicode (they could be lists of unicode).

0.4 (2009-09-10)
----------------

- Purge Solr when importing a SolrIndex via GenericSetup.

0.3 (2009-09-10)
----------------

- Made field handlers more flexible.  Now they can add any
  kind of query parameter to the Solr query.

- The default field handler now generates "fq" parameters
  instead of "q" parameters.  This seems to fit the intent of
  the Solr authors much better.

- Renamed "solr_additional" to "solr_params".

0.2 (2009-09-09)
----------------

- Added a GenericSetup profile that replaces SearchableText
  with a SolrIndex.

- Renamed the catalog parameter for passing extra args to Solr
  "solr_additional".  Also renamed the response callback
  parameter to "solr_callback".

0.1 (2009-09-09)
----------------

- First release
